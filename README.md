## Project Objective
Disasters often generate massive volumes of social media posts. However, distinguishing real, actionable disaster-related information from unrelated chatter remains a challenge.

This project seeks to solve the binary text classification problem of identifying whether a given tweet describes a real disaster (target = 1) or not (target = 0). This task is significant in the field of Natural Language Processing as it involves challenges such as short text classification, informal language, and handling noisy and ambiguous data â€” all of which are common in real-world NLP applications.
